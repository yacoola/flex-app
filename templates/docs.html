    <h1>Welcome to the flex app !!</h1>

    <p>Welcome! When your all set up, this is the interface you'll see. You can use this app to get a notification when
      a car is available, or even automatically book flex cars. Just choose a location on the map, adjust the search
      radius,
      and request a car.</p>

    <img id=exampleimg src="/static/images/interfaceExample.png" alt="">

    <p>Selecting automatic book will, of course, automatically book the car. When you choose ethical mode, the flex-app
      will wait 5 seconds before pouncing on a car. This lets the humans compete but means you might miss the car.</p>

    <p>Once the search has started, it will run for half an hour. When autobook is off, you will get a notification as
      soon as it finds a car, and the search will stop. When autobook is on, when the Flex app finds a car, it will
      attempt to book it for you, and you will be notified when a vehicle is booked. If the Flex app finds a car but
      cannot book it fast enough, you will get a notification, and the system will continue to search. If the flex epp
      encounters a problem, you will get a notification, and the search will stop. At the end of 30 minutes, if it
      cannot find you a car, you will get a notification saying no car was found.</p>







    <h2>How to setup</h2>
    <h3>Step 1 - Get the pushbullet app on your phone</h3>

    <p>The pushbullet app is used to get notifications on your phone. This will be used to notify you when a car is
      available, booked, or when there is an issue with your request.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the <a href="https://www.pushbullet.com/">pushbullet website</a> and create an account. You should also
        download the pushbullet app on your phone.</li>
      <li>Once logged in on the website. Go to settings > account and click "create access token"</li>
      <li>Copy the access token and send it to me, and I will add you as an approved user of the website.</li>
      <li>Once approved. you can access the flex-app website using the following url </li>
    </ul>

    <pre>flexflexflex.onrender.com/?key=<"You're access token goes here"></pre>

    <p>for example:</p>

    <pre>flexflexflex.onrender.com/?key=o.vLKjkfevjeKLVjewonVLKJefwlkvVjs</pre>

    <p>Don't forget to log in to pushbullet on your phone. You can use the website to get notifications of available
      cars, but you need to do the next steps to enable automatic booking.</p>


    <h3>Step 2 - Setup auto login</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Email</li>

    </ul>

      these instructions were made for chrome </p>

    <ul>

      </li>
      <li>Record the CustomerID number (5).</li>
    </ul>
